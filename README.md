## [Alpine-MySQL][234]
#### Container for Alpine Linux + S6 + MySQL/MariaDB
---

This [image][233] serves as the base image for applications
/ services that need a [MySQL][135] database running.

If it is required to run in the same container as the app is
running, use this container as the source for your app. Can setup
i.e create the databse user and the database specified in the
command line if not already exists.

Has handy **backup** and **restore** commands available inside the
image.

Based on [Alpine Linux][131] from my [alpine-s6][132] image with
the [s6][133] init system [overlayed][134] in it.

The image is tagged respectively for the following architectures,
* **armhf**
* **armv7l**
* **aarch64**
* **x86_64** (retagged as the `latest` )

**non-x86_64** builds have embedded binfmt_misc support and contain the
[qemu-user-static][105] binary that allows for running it also inside
an x86_64 environment that has it.

---
#### Get the Image
---

Pull the image for your architecture it's already available from
Docker Hub.

```
# make pull
docker pull woahbase/alpine-mysql:x86_64
```

---
#### Run
---

If you want to run images for other architectures, you will need
to have binfmt support configured for your machine. [**multiarch**][104],
has made it easy for us containing that into a docker container.

```
# make regbinfmt
docker run --rm --privileged multiarch/qemu-user-static:register --reset
```

Without the above, you can still run the image that is made for your
architecture, e.g for an x86_64 machine..

This image already has a user `mysql` configured to drop
privileges to the passed `PUID`/`PGID` which is ideal if its used
to run in non-root mode. That way you only need to specify the
values at runtime and pass the `-u mysql` if need be. (run `id`
in your terminal to see your own `PUID`/`PGID` values.)

Configurations are located at `/etc/my.cnf`, `/etc/my.cnf.d/*` and the data at
`/var/lib/mysql`. The default `my.cnf` is provided, replace the
file or rebind the whole directory with your configs. Otherwise
the environment variables `MYSQL_ROOT_PWD` `MYSQL_USER`
`MYSQL_USER_PWD` `MYSQL_USER_DB` are used to setup a non-root user
and a database if not done already.

Running `make` starts the service.

```
# make
docker run --rm -it \
  --name docker_mysql --hostname mysql \
  -c 512 -m 512m \
  -e PGID=100 -e PUID=1000 \
  -e MYSQL_ROOT_PWD=insecurebydefault \
  -e MYSQL_USER=mysql \
  -e MYSQL_USER_PWD=insecurebydefault \
  -e MYSQL_USER_DB=test \
  -p 3306:3306 \
  -v data:/var/lib/mysql \
  -v /etc/hosts:/etc/hosts:ro \
  -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro \
  woahbase/alpine-mysql:x86_64
```

Stop the container with a timeout, (defaults to 2 seconds)

```
# make stop
docker stop -t 2 docker_mysql
```

Removes the container, (always better to stop it first and `-f`
only when needed most)

```
# make rm
docker rm -f docker_mysql
```

Restart the container with

```
# make restart
docker restart docker_mysql
```

---
#### Shell access
---

Get a shell inside a already running container,

```
# make debug
docker exec -it docker_mysql /bin/bash
```

set user or login as root,

```
# make rdebug
docker exec -u root -it docker_mysql /bin/bash
```

To check logs of a running container in real time

```
# make logs
docker logs -f docker_mysql
```

Backup database

```
# make backup DBNAME=<databasename>
# the backup will be named <databasename>.sql and is dropped
# inside /var/lib/mysql/backups (local path: data/backups)
docker exec -it docker_mysql /scripts/run.sh backup <databasename>
```
Restore a single database

```
# make restore DBNAME=<databasename>
# restores the <databasename> database from the file
# /var/lib/mysql/backups/<databasename>.sql
# (local path: data/backups/<databasename>.sql should exist)
docker exec -it docker_mysql /scripts/run.sh restore <databasename>
```

### Development
---

If you have the repository access, you can clone and
build the image yourself for your own system, and can push after.

---
#### Setup
---

Before you clone the [repo][231], you must have [Git][101], [GNU make][102],
and [Docker][103] setup on the machine.

```
git clone https://github.com/woahbase/alpine-mysql
cd alpine-mysql
```
You can always skip installing **make** but you will have to
type the whole docker commands then instead of using the sweet
make targets.

---
#### Build
---

You need to have binfmt_misc configured in your system to be able
to build images for other architectures.

Otherwise to locally build the image for your system.
[`ARCH` defaults to `x86_64`, need to be explicit when building
for other architectures.]

```
# make ARCH=x86_64 build
# sets up binfmt if not x86_64
docker build --rm --compress --force-rm \
  --no-cache=true --pull \
  -f ./Dockerfile_x86_64 \
  --build-arg DOCKERSRC=woahbase/alpine-s6:x86_64 \
  --build-arg PGID=1000 \
  --build-arg PUID=1000 \
  -t woahbase/alpine-mysql:x86_64 \
  .
```

To check if its working..

```
# make ARCH=x86_64 test
docker run --rm -it \
  --name docker_mysql --hostname mysql \
  -e PGID=1000 -e PUID=1000 \
  woahbase/alpine-mysql:x86_64 \
  sh -ec 'mysql --version'
```

And finally, if you have push access,

```
# make ARCH=x86_64 push
docker push woahbase/alpine-mysql:x86_64
```
